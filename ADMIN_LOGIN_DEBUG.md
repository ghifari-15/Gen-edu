# Debug Admin Authentication Issue

## Current Status
- ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Login endpoint `/api/auth/admin/login-mock` works
- ✅ Auth verification endpoint `/api/auth/admin/me-mock` works
- ✅ JWT token generation and verification working

## Test Credentials
- **Email**: admin@genedu.com
- **Password**: admin123

## Issue Description
User reports that clicking "Sign in to Admin" redirects back to admin page instead of logging in properly.

## Testing Steps

### 1. Manual Browser Test
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/admin
2. Should redirect to: http://localhost:3001/admin/login
3. Enter credentials and click "Sign in to Admin"
4. Check browser developer console for logs
5. Should redirect to: http://localhost:3001/admin (if successful)

### 2. Console Logs to Check
- Login attempt logs
- Authentication response
- Cookie setting
- Redirect behavior

### 3. Expected Flow
```
/admin → (not authenticated) → /admin/login → (login success) → /admin
```

### 4. Potential Issues
- Cookie not being set properly
- Client-side authentication check failing
- Redirect loop
- Browser cache issues

### 5. Browser Developer Tools Check
1. **Network Tab**: Check login request/response
2. **Application Tab**: Check cookies after login
3. **Console Tab**: Check for error messages

## Resolution Steps Taken
1. ✅ Fixed JWT token generation in login endpoint
2. ✅ Added `credentials: 'include'` to fetch requests
3. ✅ Removed duplicate cookie setting on client-side
4. ✅ Added debug logging to track authentication flow

## Next Steps
Test the login flow manually in browser and check console logs to identify where the issue occurs.
